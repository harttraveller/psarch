Are you a researcher annoyed about the fact that the pushshift reddit archives are no longer available? We have something in common!

Thankfully I archived them before they disappeared... If you did too, this package provides a straightforward way to interact with and query them.

I'll add more docs soon.

## Data Archives

If you do not have the data and would like get a copy, I'd be willing to offer some alternatives for free, providing you meet the following criteria:

- You are a:
  - academic researcher
    - (corporate R&D folks can message me, I'll probably approve if you're OpenAI, but not if you're Nestle)
  - Either a citizen of part of an organization in one of the following 5 countries:
    - United States
    - United Kingdom
    - Canada
    - Australia
    - New Zealand


  - I will try to get around to adding a web form to request a compressed copy of the archives soon, which will ideally also include current data gathered by the systems I'm building to archive reddit. This will take a little while to get up and running, perhaps a week or two.
    - Even if you do have this, you will still need to be willing to download a *lot* of data.
    - And you
- I may add a web service similar to the original service
