This python package allows you to run your own self hosted and searchable archive of the pushshift archives.

Originally it also allowed you to download the reddit archives from [files.pushshift.io](https://files.pushshift.io) - however these are no longer available.

If you saved pushshift reddit archives before they were nuked, you may still find this package useful.

If you didn't save the archives, but you still want to use it to search the reddit archives, more information can be found on the [documentation](https://www.harttraveller.com/psarch/) website.
