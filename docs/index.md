!!! Abstract "Description"
    This python package allows you to run your own self hosted and searchable archive of reddit data, sourced from [pushshift](https://pushshift.io/).

!!! Note
    The data contained in this package has been filtered and normalized to reduce its size and increase format consistency. This results in the loss of information which may be useful for some types of research. For more information, see the [normalization](normalization.md) page.

!!! Quote "Citation"
    If you use this package in an academic context, citation is appreciated. Also note this project is dependent on the [pushshift reddit dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08435) for which a separate citation is recommended.
