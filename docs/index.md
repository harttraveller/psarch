!!! abstract "Description"
    This python package allows you to run your own self hosted and searchable archive of reddit data. Originally it also allowed you to download the reddit archives from [files.pushshift.io](https://files.pushshift.io) but alas...

!!! question "Archives"
    If you saved pushshift reddit archives before they were nuked, you may still find this package useful. You can get started on the [setup](setup.md) page. If you didn't save the archives, but you still want to use it, you can take a look at the [data access](data.md) page.
