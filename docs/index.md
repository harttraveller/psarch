!!! abstract "Description"
    This python package *was* going to allow you to run your own self hosted and searchable archive of reddit data, but alas...

!!! question "Archives"
    If you saved pushshift reddit archives before they were nuked, you may still find this package useful. If you didn't, but you still want to use it, check the [data access](data.md) page.

!!! bug "Support"
    This package has only been tested on MacOS. If you run into a problem, please submit a GitHub Issue. I will try to address it time permitting.
