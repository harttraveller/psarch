# Data Access

If you do not have the data and would like get a copy, I *might* be able to provide you with a copy - or perhaps even access to a streamlined web service that replicates and greatly enhances the original functionality of pushshift, and is (maybe) still actively archiving data.

I am interested in helping people who meet the following criteria:

1. You represent an academic institution or government agency.
2. You are a citizen (or the entity you are a subset of is based in) either: US, CA, UK, AU, NZ.
3. You are willing to verify your identity.

If you are an individual - apologies but no.

??? note "Corporation Approval"
    Corporations that are doing academic research for the benefit of humanity based in the US, or contractors with the USG are the exceptions here.

??? question "Why block individuals?"

    There is a good reason for this, but it's one of those things where if you know it, you know it, and if you don't know it, and I told you, you still wouldn't know it, and I'd be saying the quiet part out loud, thus pissing off the people who know it, so I won't bother.

With that said, I expect some OSINT skids, creepy exs, and IRA schmucks might still apply pretending to be someone they aren't, so I implemented a deterrence mechanism to discourage adversarial or malicious actors.

Some of you may "test this deterrence mechanism", but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
