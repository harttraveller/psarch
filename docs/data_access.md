# Data Access

If you do not have the data and would like get a copy, I *might* be able to provide you with a copy - or perhaps even access to a streamlined web service that replicates and greatly enhances the original functionality of pushshift, and is (maybe) still actively archiving data.

I am interested in helping people who meet the following criteria:

1. You represent an academic institution or government agency.
2. You are a citizen of and the entity you are a subset of is based in either: US, CA, UK, AU, NZ.
3. You are willing to verify your identity.

If you are an individual - apologies but no.

??? question "What if I already have the data archives?"
    If you already have the archives, you can just use this package. It's open source and free. My reasoning for not distributing the data publicly primarily pertains to my concern for potential abuse by bad actors. With that said, it's still incredibly valuable for good actors, so I think Reddit definitely could have handled this a lot better.

    ??? note "Good Actors vs. Bad Actors"
        Of course, on a deeper philosophical level, there are no good or bad actors. There are only competing interests and the driving force of evolution and natural selection. Is a tapeworm bad? If you are a human, yes. If you are a tapeworm, no - then humans are bad. This aside, I happen to be a human, and thus I have to have some personal standards. I could write several pages about this, but I'll put that somewhere else. Suffice to say the heuristic you can use for whether I'll provide access is:

        - You want access because you want to do something to help humanity -> Access granted
        - You want access because you want something to help yourself -> Access denied

        Plus meeting the formal criteria above.

??? question "Are corporations approved?"
    Corporations that are doing academic research for the benefit of humanity based in the US, or contractors with the USG are the exceptions here.

??? question "Why block individuals?"

    There is a good reason for this, but it's one of those things where if you know it, you know it, and if you don't know it, and I told you, you still wouldn't know it, and I'd be saying the quiet part out loud, thus pissing off the people who know it, so I won't bother.

With that said, I expect some OSINT skids, creepy exs, and IRA schmucks might still apply pretending to be someone they aren't, so I implemented a deterrence mechanism to discourage adversarial or malicious actors.

Some of you may "test this deterrence mechanism", but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
