# Data

If you do not have the data and would like get a copy, I *might* be able to provide you with a copy - or perhaps even access to a streamlined web service that replicates and greatly enhances the original functionality of pushshift, and is (maybe) still actively archiving data. However, you would have to meet all of the following criteria:

1. You represent an academic institution or federal agency based in: US, CA, UK, AU, or NZ.
2. You are a citizen of: US, CA, UK, AU, or NZ.
3. You are willing to verify your identity.

!!! question "Do I have to pay for data access?"
    No, I'm happy to provide it for free to research purposes to entities acting in good faith who meet the criteria above.

It does cost me money though, which comes out of my paycheck. Given I also have to pay for tuition, caffeine, ramen, etc. I can't afford to provide access to everyone.

??? question "Why not upload the data on kaggle or something analogous?"
    The reasoning for not distributing the data publicly primarily pertains to the concern for potential abuse by bad actors. With that said, it's still incredibly valuable for good actors, so Reddit probably could have handled this a lot better. If you don't meet the criteria above, you can also probably look around for other data sources though. Try visiting [r/pushshift](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift) and looking around a bit.

Of course, on a deeper philosophical level, there are no good or bad actors. There are only competing interests and the driving force of evolution and natural selection. Is a tapeworm bad? If you are a human, yes. If you are a tapeworm, no - then humans are bad. I could write several pages about this, but I'll put that somewhere else. I digress, the heuristic you can use for whether I'll provide access is:

- You want access because you want to do something to help humanity -> Access granted
- You want access because you want something to help yourself -> Factored in
- You want access because you want to do something to hurt humanity -> Access denied

Plus meeting the formal criteria above.

??? question "What if I already have the data archives?"
    If you already have the archives, you can just use this package. It's open source and free.

??? question "What if I represent a company?"
    US companies or contractors with the USG that are doing research that either (A) benefits humanity or (B) pertains to national security can access the data.
