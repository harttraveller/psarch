# Data

If you do not have the data and would like get a copy, I may be able to provide you with a copy - or access to a service that replicates and enhances the original functionality of pushshift.

I am interested in helping people who meet the following criteria:

1. You represent an academic institution or government agency.
2. You are a citizen (or the entity you are a subset of is based in) either: US, CA, UK, AU, NZ.
3. You are willing to verify your identity.

note: too edgy

I should add the form in a hidden comment, to make it harder for script kiddies to find.

!!! note "Individuals"

    If you are an individual - apologies but no. There is a good reason for this, but it's one of those things where if you know it, you know it, and if you don't know it, you wouldn't know it if I told you, so I won't bother.

    With that said, I expect some OSINT script kiddies, creepy exs, and IRA schmucks might still apply pretending to be someone they aren't, so I implemented a deterrence mechanism to discourage adversarial or malicious actors.

    Some of you may... *test this deterrence mechanism*, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.
